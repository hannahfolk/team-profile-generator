Hannah Folk Template Engine
=======

## Description

This is my template engine, created using node.js and object-oriented programming.

## Process

I started out by running the given tests and correcting my constructor functions. Then I generated HTML templates. Next I wrote my app.js, and worked with getting recursive inquirer prompts to work. Finally, I figured out how to feed a Javascript with jQuery into my dynamically generated HTML file, which was the most frustrating.
